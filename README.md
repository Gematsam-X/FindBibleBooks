# FindBibleBooks

This project is a bible-books-finder. Enter the name of the Bible book in the input field at the center, and you will be provided with a link referring to that book.

Developed using the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, available on the official website of Jehovah's Witnesses (`https://www.jw.org/`).

## Project sharing

In the root folder of the project, there is a file called `FindBibleBooks.html`: it includes HTML, CSS, and JS all in one file to share with friends. I hope you find this file useful!!
